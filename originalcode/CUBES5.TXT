CUBES5 created by Ken Silverman (http://advsys.net/ken)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:

   CUBES5 was a side project I did during the development of Build. I started
working on the original cube engine in 1994, during a time when Apogee was
pressuring me to make a next generation engine (comparable with Quake 1). In
1995, I made many enhancements which you see in this version. I was
researching several things as I was developing this:

   * rendering arbitrary polygons quickly (selecting how to interpolate)
   * front-to-back occlusion (hidden surface removal better than a z-buffer)

   CUBES5 renders using lines of constant Z (in other words, diagonal lines)
I used a neat trick to remove a lot of the jagged edges that are normally seen
with diagonal line rendering. CUBES was also my first engine to use portals.
Also, it was the first time I had reliable collision detection in a 6D engine.

   CUBES5 was originally written for Watcom 10.5/10.6/11.0. I'm not exactly
sure which version I was using at the time but it doesn't matter. Just before
releasing the source code, (in 2005), I fixed things to compile cleanly with
Open Watcom 1.3. (I added function prototypes and fixed up the makefile.) You
can download Open Watcom 1.3 freely at: http://openwatcom.org
To compile, enter a command prompt, set up the Watcom environment, and simply
type "wmake" in the proper directory.

Release history:

02/07/2000: Original release of CUBES5 (just EXE and game data)
10/17/2005: Released CUBES5 source code. Here are some original filedates of
               source code files before I prepared them for release:
              10/30/1995  01:31 PM    3,504 C.ASM
              07/10/1995  11:51 AM   13,460 CACHE2D.C
              10/30/1995  12:53 PM  100,929 CUBES5.C

Known annoyances:

   * You can use BSETUP.EXE (the build editor setup program) to select
      different default keys and video modes. You may have a problem with
      selecting the video modes because they are misaligned, for example if
      you select 360*200 mode, it might actually be 640*480 mode in cubes5.

   * This program is generally pretty stable. However, if you go nuts and
      hold down the delete key, you're asking for trouble. If the board gets
      too complex, you will likely cause a crash. (the board map is 16*16*16)

   * There are no options for shading and palette.

Contact info:

If you do anything cool with CUBES5, I would love to hear about it! I prefer
that you contact me in either of these ways:

 1. Write about it on my personal forum ("advsys.net/ken" topic) at:
    http://jonof.edgenetwork.org

 2. You can write me a private E-mail (address can be found at the bottom of
    my main page). Please use this for license requests.

If you have any questions or feature requests about other things in CUBES5, it
doesn't hurt to ask, although keep in mind that I haven't really worked with
the code since 1995!
